Task: Create a RESTful API for a simple note-taking application.

Requirements:

Use Spring Boot to create the API.
~~The API should support CRUD operations for notes (Create, Read, Update, Delete).~~
~~Each note should have a title and content.~~
~~Implement appropriate error handling and validation for the API.~~
~~Use a database of your choice (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, H2) to persist the notes.~~
~~Implement appropriate endpoints to retrieve all notes, retrieve a single note by ID, create a new note, update an
existing note, and delete a note.~~
~~The API should follow RESTful principles and return appropriate HTTP status codes.~~

Bonus (optional):

Implement pagination for retrieving all notes.
Implement authentication and authorization for the API using Spring Security.
